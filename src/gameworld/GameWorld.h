 * \class GameWorld
 * \brief Handles the Game World functionality.
 *
 * The game world sets up and manages the components of the game world. It
 * handles the displaying of components, spawning of AI, sound, lighting and the
 * GUI.
 *
 * \author Timothy Veletta, Arran Ford, Hamish Carrier
 * \date 29/09/12
 * \version 01 - Timothy Veletta 29/09/12
 *		Created file with Display, Keyboard, Mouse, SpecialKeyFunc and Init
 *		functions.
 * \version 02 - Timothy Veletta 14/10/12
 *		Added Reshape, MouseMove as well as functions to manage objects within
 *		the world.
 * \version 03 - Timothy Veletta 22/10/12
 *		Added a camera, player and island object.
 * \version 04 - Timothy Veletta 23/10/12
 *		Added functions to measure frames per second as well as registering
 *		key presses and turning them into player movements.
 * \version 05 - Timothy Veletta 25/10/12
 * 		Limited the frame rate to 85 FPS, halved the memory usage.
 * \version 06 - Arran Ford 28/10/12
 * 		Added in spawning and AI management.
 * \version 07 - Hamish Carrier 29/10/12
 *		Added in GUI creation for the game world.
 * \version 08 - Array Ford 29/10/12
 *		Added in music that plays when the game world is entered.
 * \version 09 - Timothy Veletta 29/10/12
 *		Moved existing object management code to another class.
 * \version 10 - Arran Ford 30/10/12
 *		AI maintenance things. 4 different types of AI spawning.
 * \version 11 - Hamish Carrier 30/10/12
 *		Working on GUI, added textures to the GUI and various GUI buttons.
 * \version 12 - Hamish Carrier 31/10/12
 *		Added in improved island.
 * \version 13 - Arran Ford 01/11/12
 *		Lighting code added in.
