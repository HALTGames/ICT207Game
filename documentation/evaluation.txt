WHAT DOESN'T WORK?
******************************
- Sometimes when you start a new game, the player can't move.
- The reticule doesn't display properly.
- We tried to get a particle engine working however it does not so its not
  actually used in the program despite being included in the source
- The model importer loads in the model every time an object requires a model
  of that type
